Carp
++++

Carp is for code templates.  It cuts down on typing, so you won't get
CARP-al tunnel.  Harharhar.

Stuff that works right now
==========================

This really works::

    $ python src/carp.py carpfiles/bogus.carp --define aaa=cat bbb=dog

That will put replace aaa with cat and bbb with dog.

Possible improvements
=====================

*   Install carp as a script in the path (edit setup.py).

*   List required variables for a carpfile.

*   Find carpfiles folder by searching up parent folders.

*   List carp templates inside the carpfiles folder.

*   Store templates into the carpfiles folder (i.e., register
    carpfiles, with descriptions, etc).

*   Build projects with folders and files rather than just a single
    file.
