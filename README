Summary
=======

Carp cuts down on typing, so you won't get CARP-al tunnel.  Harharhar.



Example usage
=============

Try it like this::

    $ cd some-project-you-already-have
    $ mkdir carpdir # your templates will go in here
    $ carp-list # you will get nothing back, since you have no templates
    $ carp-add some-file-that-already-exists
    $ carp-list # now you will see that file
