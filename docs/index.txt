Summary
=======

Carp cuts down on typing by letting you store code templates (using
jinja2_) and then render them.

I named this project carp because this project will save me from CARP-al
tunnel.  Harharhar.

Isn't this a bad idea?
======================

Yes.  Terrible idea.  Good programmers use libraries and inheritance and
dynamic code generation and run-time message passing to shrink
redundancy.

Shitty programmers use copy-paste.  And only the worst programmer
imaginable would ever design and use a copy-paste framework.

This project is an abomination.

Hurry back to `hacker news`_!

Instructions
============

The first thing to do is make a directory named "carpdir" at
the top of your project::

    $ cd ~/src/my-awesome-project
    $ mkdir carpdir

That's where carp will store templates.

Pick a file that you want to use as a template and copy it to some
out-of-the-way place::

    $ cp script.py /tmp/base_script.py

Now edit that copy and replace the text that you want to be passed in as
a parameter, by using double-curly braces, like this::

    {{project_name}}

Actually, you can use any jinja2_ tricks, because the files will be run
as jinja2_ templates.

Add this template like this::

    $ carp-add /tmp/base_script.py

You can get a list of required variables to pass in::

    $ carp-info base_script.py

And now you can render that template::

    $ carp-render base_script.py --define project_name=bogus

That will write a bunch of stuff to standard output, so use redirect to
put it in a file::

    $ carp-render base_script.py --define project_name=bogus > bogus_script.py


Future plans
============

*   Pretty-up the error messaging when somebody forgets to define a
    variable.

*   Add descriptions and other metadata to templates.

*   Support templates that are more than just a single file.  Allow
    templates to include folders and subfolders and files.

*   Support command-line tab completion for template names.
